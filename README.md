# 🛡️ Startup Security Readiness Kit (MVS Kit)

The **Startup Security Readiness Kit (MVS Kit)** is a lean, practical toolkit designed to help early-stage startups build foundational security processes using open-source tools and documented best practices without fat cybersecurity budgets.

This kit supports FinTechs, SaaS, Healthcare, and other growing teams who need to demonstrate readiness for compliance, security maturity, and secure operations from day one.

- **Security Awareness**  
  User training guides, phishing simulation planning, and tabletop exercise walkthroughs.

- **SOC Modules (Security Operations Center)**  
  Open-source-based SOC architecture, detection tuning, tool overviews, and compliance mapping (ISO 27001, NIST CSF, SOC 2).

- **Operational Checklists & Templates**

## ⚙️ How to Use

1. **Browse folders**: The kit is organized into clearly labeled folders (e.g., `/policies`, `/SOC`, `/inventories`, `etc`)
2. **Pick what fits**: You don’t need to use everything. Some parts may be heavier than what your startup needs today.
3. **Start small, scale wisely**: Use what aligns with your current stage and maturity — then grow into other areas as you scale.

> 🔍 **Note**: The toolkit is intentionally broad to accommodate different startup types and security maturity levels. You are encouraged to browse through the folders and adapt what is most relevant to your context and capability.

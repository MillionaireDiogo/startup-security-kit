# 🚨 Incident Response Plan – Fintech Startup

## 🎯 Purpose

This Incident Response Plan (IRP) outlines the procedures for detecting, responding to, containing, eradicating, and recovering from cybersecurity incidents that impact the organization’s systems, data, services, or customers.

> 📚 Aligned with:  
> - NIST SP 800-61r2 (Computer Security Incident Handling Guide)  
> - PCI-DSS (for handling payment data)  
> - ISO/IEC 27035 (Information Security Incident Management)

---

## 🧩 Scope

This plan applies to all employees, systems, applications, and third-party services that manage or process:

- Customer data
- Payment or financial data
- Infrastructure and source code
- Communication channels (e.g., email, Slack, etc.)

---

## 🧭 Incident Categories

| Type | Examples |
|------|----------|
| 🛑 Data Breach | Unauthorized access or disclosure of PII or financial data |
| 🐛 Malware Attack | Ransomware, keyloggers, or viruses detected in systems |
| 🔓 Unauthorized Access | Privilege escalation, insider threats, or credential theft |
| 🌐 Service Disruption | DDoS attacks, downtime of customer-facing systems |
| ⚠️ Policy Violation | Use of shadow IT, insecure device access, or password sharing |

## 🔄 Incident Response Lifecycle

### 1. **Preparation**
- Define roles and responsibilities (see team below)
- Maintain contact info for vendors, legal, and regulators
- Ensure logs are centralized and monitored (SIEM)
- Conduct regular tabletop exercises and drills

### 2. **Detection & Analysis**
- Monitor using EDR, SIEM, email alerts, cloud logs
- Log and timestamp all indicators (IP, timestamp, attack vector)
- Triage severity: Low, Medium, High, Critical
- Identify affected systems, users, and data types

### 3. **Containment**
- Short-term: isolate affected endpoints, revoke access
- Long-term: apply patches, remove backdoors, rotate credentials
- Avoid tipping off attackers before containment is ready

### 4. **Eradication**
- Remove malicious files or software
- Block malicious IPs or URLs
- Conduct deep scans across affected infrastructure

### 5. **Recovery**
- Restore systems from known-good backups
- Monitor for signs of reinfection
- Validate integrity of restored systems before re-opening to users

### 6. **Post-Incident Activities**
- Conduct root cause analysis
- Write full incident report (including MITRE ATT&CK mapping)
- Share lessons learned internally
- Update IR documentation and controls
- Notify affected parties (as per GDPR/NDPR)

## 👥 Roles & Responsibilities

| Role | Responsibility |
|------|----------------|
| Incident Manager | Oversees response process, escalates as needed |

| DevOps Engineer | Assists with containment and recovery of cloud systems |
| Legal/Compliance | Handles notification obligations and evidence management |
| Comms Lead | Crafts internal/external communication, press, customers |

---

## 🔔 Communication Guidelines

- Use **secure channels** (Slack private channel, Signal, email with PGP)
- No discussing incident on public platforms or unapproved channels
- Document everything in a shared IR tracker (e.g., Jira, Notion)

---

## 📞 Notification Matrix

| Entity | Notify When |
|--------|-------------|
| Legal/Compliance | Always |
| Customers | If breach involves PII or financial data (within 72h, GDPR) |
| Regulators | As required by jurisdiction (e.g., NDPR, PCI-DSS) |
| Partners | If incident affects shared infrastructure/data |

---

## 🧪 Testing & Review

| Activity | Frequency |
|----------|-----------|
| Tabletop Exercises | Twice per year |
| Incident Playbook Review | Quarterly |
| IR Team Drill | Every 6 months |

---

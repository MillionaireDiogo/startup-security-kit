# 📦 Data Handling Policy – Fintech Startup

## 🎯 Purpose

The purpose of this policy is to ensure the secure collection, usage, storage, sharing, and deletion of customer and business data — particularly **Personally Identifiable Information (PII)**, **payment data**, and **sensitive financial records**. As a fintech startup, handling data responsibly is essential for maintaining user trust and complying with financial regulations.

Note: The **data handling guide** above aligns primarily with **GDPR**, **NDPR**, and **PCI-DSS**, addressing principles like data minimization, encryption, consent, and breach notification.

## 🛡️ Data Classification

All data must be classified into the following tiers:

| Classification | Examples | Handling Requirements |
|----------------|----------|------------------------|
| 🔴 **Confidential** | PII, bank account details, card numbers, passwords, KYC data | Encryption (in transit and at rest), access restricted to authorized roles |
| 🟡 **Internal** | Internal emails, roadmap docs, system logs | Access limited to internal staff, not shared externally |
| 🟢 **Public** | Marketing materials, public blog posts | No restriction |

---

## 🔐 Data Protection Requirements

| Requirement | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| 🔒 Encryption In-Transit | All data must be transmitted over TLS 1.2+ (HTTPS, secure APIs) |
| 🔒 Encryption At-Rest | All stored data must use AES-256 encryption (e.g., S3, RDS, GCP, Azure) |
| 🔄 Tokenization | Payment data should use PCI-compliant tokenization (e.g., via Stripe, Paystack) |
| 🕵️ Access Controls | Role-based access, least privilege, and audit trails for all sensitive data |
| 📦 Backup & Restore | Daily backups stored securely and tested quarterly |
| 🔄 Retention Policy | Only retain data for as long as needed for business or legal reasons |
| 🗑️ Secure Disposal | Data must be securely wiped or anonymized when no longer needed |

---

## 🧾 Data Collection Principles

Fintechs must follow **privacy by design**. All data collection must be:

- 📌 **Purpose-Specific** – Only collect what's necessary (e.g., for onboarding or KYC)
- 👥 **Consent-Driven** – Must obtain explicit user consent (with clear privacy notices)
- ✂️ **Minimized** – Avoid collecting excessive data or duplicate copies

> Ensure consent forms meet GDPR & NDPR requirements.

## 🔄 Data Access Guidelines

| Role | Access Level |
|------|--------------|
| Developers | Pseudonymized test data only |
| Customer Support | Masked PII (last 4 digits of PAN, redacted names) |
| Finance Team | Access to transactions, not credentials |
| Admins | Full audit logs, no direct data unless needed for ops |

> ✅ All access must be logged and periodically reviewed.

---

## 🌍 Third-Party Data Sharing

You must:

- Vet all vendors for **security and privacy compliance**
- Sign **Data Processing Agreements (DPAs)** where required
- Share only the **minimum data necessary**
- Regularly review vendor access and audit logs

> Vendors with access to financial data or PII must support encryption, access logs, and breach notifications.

---

## 🚨 Breach Handling & Notification

In case of suspected or confirmed data breach:

- Notify the **Security Lead** within 1 hour
- Contain breach, collect forensic logs
- Notify affected users within 72 hours (as per GDPR)
- Document root cause and mitigation steps

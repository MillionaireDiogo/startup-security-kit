# 🎯 SIEM Tuning Tips for Startup SOC

## 🧩 Purpose

This guide provides practical tips for tuning your SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) system to reduce alert fatigue, prioritize real threats, and improve detection quality — especially when using open-source tools in a resource-constrained startup environment.

---

## 🔍 Why Tuning Matters

- 🚫 Reduces **false positives** and alert fatigue
- 🧠 Helps **focus analyst attention** on actual threats
- 🚦 Improves **alert response times**
- 🛡️ Increases **detection precision** for compliance and incident response

---

## 🔧 Common Open-Source SIEMs in Startups

| SIEM | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Wazuh** | Agent-based with threat detection, file integrity monitoring, and rules engine |
| **Graylog** | Centralized log management with stream-based alerting |
| **ELK Stack (Elastic, Logstash, Kibana)** | Scalable log analytics and dashboarding |
| **Security Onion** | Full-stack detection and monitoring distro (includes Zeek, Suricata, Wazuh) |

---

## ✅ Core Tuning Steps

### 1. 🎚️ Baseline Normal Behavior

- Understand what “normal” looks like in your cloud, network, and endpoint activity
- Suppress repetitive benign logs (e.g., health checks, cron jobs)
- Allowlist common internal traffic (e.g., dev tools, CI/CD services)

---

### 2. 🧪 Use Sigma Rules with Context

- Convert community Sigma rules to your SIEM’s native format (e.g., Wazuh, Elasticsearch)
- Modify thresholds, source paths, or user groups to match your actual environment
- Tag alerts with severity labels (e.g., low/med/high)

### 3. 🛠️ Customize Rules for Your Stack

| Use Case | Example |
|----------|---------|
| **Cloud** | Alert on IAM policy changes or root login |
| **Web App** | Detect SQLi in nginx logs |
| **Containers** | Watch for shell spawned in Docker containers |
| **Endpoints** | Alert on suspicious PowerShell execution |

---

### 4. 🧼 Suppress the Noise

- Use **thresholds** to ignore repeated, low-risk events  
  _(e.g., block alerts on 1 failed login, alert after 5 in 10 mins)_
- Tag alerts with metadata (host type, app role, severity)
- Filter by source: don’t alert on dev/test environment noise unless needed

---

### 5. 🔄 Continuous Feedback Loop

- Build a routine: review triggered alerts weekly or after every incident
- Track false positives and tune rules accordingly
- Create a simple "log review checklist" (see `log_review_checklist.md`)
- Use TheHive or your ticketing system to track alert lifecycle

---

## 🧠 Alert Management Tips

| Practice | Benefit |
|----------|---------|
| Group alerts by type/source | Easier triage |
| Set alert severity levels | Prioritization |
| Auto-close known benign alerts | Reduces fatigue |
| Build dashboards for metrics | Visibility and trend analysis |

---

## 🔍 Prioritize These High-Value Alerts

| Category | Examples |
|----------|----------|
| Identity & Access | MFA disabled, privilege escalation, root login |
| Malware & Exploits | Known IOC detection, suspicious binaries |
| Lateral Movement | Unusual internal SSH/RDP |
| Cloud Misconfig | Public S3 bucket, IAM role change |
| Endpoint Behavior | PowerShell abuse, encoded commands |

---

## 🧪 Final Tips

- **Don’t just enable every detection rule** — tailor it to your environment.
- **Start small**: enable a few rules per use case and iterate.
- **Use severity-based alert routing**  
  _(e.g., critical → PagerDuty, medium → Email/Slack)_

## 🛠️ Tools to Help with Tuning

- 🧬 **[Sigma](https://github.com/SigmaHQ/sigma)** – Community detection rules (cross-platform)
- 🐺 **Wazuh ruleset manager** – Modify, test, or disable noisy rules
- 🔁 **Graylog pipelines** – Add conditional logic before alert generation
- 📈 **Grafana/Elastic dashboards** – Visualize alert patterns and trends

# 🐳 Container Security for Startup SOC

## 🎯 Purpose

This document outlines key container security checks and practices for startups using Docker and Kubernetes. It provides open-source-driven guidance to ensure containers are scanned, hardened, monitored, and integrated into your SOC for threat detection and incident response.

---

## 📦 Container Security Lifecycle

| Phase | Security Focus | Recommended Tools |
|-------|----------------|-------------------|
| **Build** | Scan images for known vulnerabilities | Trivy, Grype |
| **Deploy** | Enforce least privilege, runtime policies | AppArmor, seccomp, Falco |
| **Run** | Monitor container activity and detect anomalies | Falco, Wazuh |
| **Audit** | Retain logs, enforce configuration baselines | Kubernetes audit logs, OPA, Gatekeeper |

---

## 🔧 1. Build-Time Security

### 🔍 Vulnerability Scanning
- Scan container images **before deployment**.
- Block deployments if critical CVEs are detected.
- Avoid using `latest` tag for base images.

**Tools:**
- [Trivy](https://github.com/aquasecurity/trivy)
- [Grype](https://github.com/anchore/grype)
- [Dockle](https://github.com/goodwithtech/dockle)

### 📁 Dockerfile Hardening Tips
- Use minimal base images (e.g., Alpine, Distroless)
- Drop root privileges (`USER nonroot`)
- Remove unnecessary packages
- Pin versions (`FROM python:3.11.0` not `python:latest`)

---

## 🛡️ 2. Runtime Security

### 🔐 Isolation & Policies
- Enable **AppArmor** and **seccomp** profiles.
- Limit container capabilities (`--cap-drop all`).
- Enforce read-only root filesystem where possible.
- Use namespaces and cgroups correctly.

### 🔄 Image Integrity
- Sign images (e.g., with Cosign) and verify at deploy time.

---

## 🧠 3. Threat Detection & Logging

### 🕵️ Behavior Monitoring
- Use **Falco** to detect suspicious container activity like:
  - Terminal shells inside containers
  - File access in sensitive directories
  - Privilege escalation attempts

**Tools:**
- [Falco](https://falco.org/)
- Wazuh + Docker or K8s integration
- Kubernetes audit logs → Graylog/SIEM

---

## 🔄 4. Configuration Policies

### ✅ Admission Control
- Use **Open Policy Agent (OPA)** with **Gatekeeper** to:
  - Block privileged pods
  - Enforce label/tag standards
  - Require resource limits and liveness probes

### 📊 Kubernetes Hardening
- Disable unused features (e.g., `kube-dashboard`)
- Rotate secrets using Kubernetes secrets or Vault
- Restrict API server access via RBAC

---

## 📦 Container-Specific Log Sources

| Source | Integration Tip |
|--------|------------------|
| Docker daemon logs | Pipe into FluentBit or Wazuh |
| Kubernetes audit logs | Send to centralized SIEM |
| Falco alerts | Integrate with TheHive or alert manager |
| Image scan results | Store in artifact repo or S3 |
| CI/CD logs | Export scan results from pipelines |

---

## 🧾 Summary Checklist

- [x] Trivy scans in CI/CD
- [x] Dockerfiles follow hardening checklist
- [x] Runtime policies via Falco
- [x] OPA + Gatekeeper admission control
- [x] Logs sent to SIEM (Graylog, Wazuh)
- [x] Containers do not run as root
- [x] Secrets are not baked into images

---

## 🚀 Quick Wins for Startups

- Automate image scanning in your GitHub Actions or GitLab CI
- Use Falco with default rules to get visibility fast
- Create a minimal base image template for devs to start securely

# ☁️ Cloud vs. On-Prem SOC Considerations

## 🎯 Purpose

This document provides a comparison of cloud-based vs. on-premises SOC deployments for startups. The goal is to guide lean fintech teams in selecting the **right hosting model** for their monitoring and detection stack.

---

## 🧭 Context for Startups

Fintech startups often:

- Use **cloud-native infrastructure** (AWS, Azure, GCP)
- Have limited security staff and physical infrastructure
- Need **quick scalability** and **low setup cost**
- Must satisfy **regulatory and customer assurance requirements**

A **cloud-first SOC stack** is often ideal — but on-prem can be relevant for very specific use cases (e.g., compliance-heavy regions or offline systems).

## 🆚 Cloud vs. On-Prem

| Criteria | Cloud-Based SOC | On-Premises SOC |
|---------|------------------|------------------|
| **Cost** | Lower upfront, pay-as-you-go | High CapEx (hardware, licenses) |
| **Scalability** | Easily scales with workloads | Manual scaling, physical limits |
| **Deployment Speed** | Fast (Docker, Terraform, cloud images) | Slower (procurement, physical setup) |
| **Maintenance** | Managed services or containers | Manual patching, monitoring |
| **Log Source Compatibility** | Easy integration with cloud logs (CloudTrail, etc.) | May need custom collectors |
| **Compliance** | Cloud-native services can be compliant (SOC 2, ISO 27001) | Often preferred for regulated data in specific jurisdictions |
| **Availability** | HA built-in via cloud infra | Requires redundant hardware |
| **Physical Security** | Managed by cloud provider | Must be handled in-house |

---

## ✅ Cloud-First is the Default Recommendation

For fintech startups using cloud infrastructure, the following cloud-native approach is recommended:

- Deploy SOC stack on **cloud instances** (e.g., EC2, Azure VMs)
- Use **Docker Compose** or **Kubernetes** for portability
- Store logs in encrypted cloud storage (e.g., S3 with lifecycle policies)
- Ingest cloud logs (e.g., AWS CloudTrail, VPC Flow Logs) into your SIEM
- Use **infrastructure-as-code** for repeatability (Terraform, Ansible)

---

## 🧩 When On-Premises Might Be Required

You might need a hybrid or on-prem SOC component if:

- You process **regulated data** that cannot leave a jurisdiction
- You have **offline systems** (e.g., ATMs, internal networks)
- You're required to **retain logs locally** due to compliance
- You're piloting in **air-gapped environments** (rare for early-stage)

---

## 🔐 Security Considerations for Both

| Area | Recommendation |
|------|----------------|
| Encryption | Enable at rest & in transit (TLS, volume encryption) |
| Access Control | Use MFA + RBAC for all SOC tools |
| Backup | Regularly export config and logs securely |
| Isolation | Use VPC/subnet separation for SOC services |
| Monitoring | Monitor your monitoring tools (meta-monitoring) |

## 🧪 Startup-Friendly Hybrid Example

> - Wazuh deployed on a cloud VM  
> - CloudTrail logs ingested from AWS  
> - Zeek and Suricata running in on-prem segments  
> - Graylog and TheHive in the cloud  
> - Backups to S3 with encryption + lifecycle policies

---

## 📌 Final Advice

- ☁️ **Go cloud** unless there's a legal, financial, or architectural reason not to.
- 🧠 Invest in documentation and automation (IaC, templates).
- 🧾 Make sure the model supports auditability and compliance mapping.

# 🚨 IR & Alerting Tools for Lean SOCs

> These tools help small SOC teams manage, respond to, and track alerts and incidents effectively. The goal is to build a responsive, documented workflow without depending on expensive commercial stacks.

## 🎯 Key Capabilities to Prioritize

| Capability              | Why It Matters                              |
|--------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| Alert correlation       | Combine related events for context          |
| Case management         | Track incident status, evidence, ownership  |
| Enrichment automation   | Add threat intel or reputation data         |
| Notification routing    | Deliver alerts to right people, fast        |
| Audit trail             | For compliance and lessons learned          |

## 🛠️ Recommended Tools

### 1. **TheHive**

- ✅ Open-source IR platform  
- Case and task tracking  
- Integrates with Cortex for automation  
- Links to SIEM, EDR, emails, etc.

---

### 2. **Cortex**

- Works with TheHive to automate response  
- Runs analyzers (VirusTotal, AbuseIPDB, etc.)  
- Custom responders: block IP, disable account, send email

---

### 3. **ElastAlert**

- Lightweight alerting for Elasticsearch/Graylog  
- Rule-based alerting with email, Slack, webhook support  
- Works well with open-source SIEM pipelines

---

### 4. **Zabbix / Prometheus + Alertmanager**

- Used for infrastructure monitoring  
- Useful to correlate system health issues with security events  
- Alert routing to Slack, Opsgenie, email  

---

### 5. **PagerDuty / Mattermost / Email Integrations**

- Free/low-tier services for sending alerts  
- Mattermost (open-source Slack) for secure chatOps  
- Webhooks from TheHive or ElastAlert → PagerDuty/Mattermost

## 📦 Example Alert Flow (Startup SOC)

SIEM (Wazuh/Graylog)  
↓  
Detection Rule (e.g., suspicious PowerShell)  
↓  
ElastAlert triggers → sends to TheHive  
↓  
TheHive creates case → Cortex runs enrichment  
↓  
Analyst notified (email, Mattermost)  
↓  
Escalation or resolution documented

## 🧠 Tips for Startups

- Start small — monitor alert volume and adjust thresholds  
- Don’t triage alerts in email inboxes — use a case management tool  
- Create tags for priority/severity and asset class  
- Use automation only where accuracy is high (e.g., VirusTotal lookup)  
- Build a daily alert review routine — see `log_review_checklist.md`

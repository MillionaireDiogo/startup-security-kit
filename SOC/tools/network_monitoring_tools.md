# 🌐 Network Monitoring Tools for Startup SOCs

> Network monitoring is crucial for visibility into traffic patterns, detecting anomalies, and investigating incidents. This guide covers open-source and low-cost tools suitable for startups.

---

## 🎯 What to Monitor

- Network traffic flows and metadata  
- Protocol anomalies (DNS tunneling, suspicious HTTP)  
- Intrusion detection alerts (IDS/IPS)  
- Bandwidth spikes or unusual endpoints  
- VPN connections and remote access logs

## 🛠️ Recommended Tools

### 1. **Zeek (formerly Bro)**

- Passive network traffic analyzer and IDS  
- Extracts rich metadata: DNS, HTTP, SSL, FTP, SMB, DHCP  
- Supports custom scripts for anomaly detection  
- Easily integrates with SIEM and log aggregators

### 2. **Suricata**

- High-performance IDS/IPS with protocol detection  
- Supports signature-based and anomaly detection  
- Real-time alerting and log generation  
- Compatible with open-source SIEMs (Graylog, Wazuh)

### 3. **ntopng**

- Network traffic probe and flow collector  
- Provides web-based UI with live traffic stats  
- Supports NetFlow, sFlow, IPFIX protocols  
- Useful for bandwidth and endpoint monitoring

### 5. **ntop + Elasticsearch + Grafana**

- Combine ntop flow data into Elastic Stack  
- Visualize network trends and detect anomalies  
- Correlate with logs from Wazuh and other sources

## ⚙️ Implementation Tips

- Deploy Zeek or Suricata at network chokepoints (e.g., gateway)  
- Use TAPs or SPAN ports on switches for passive monitoring  
- Regularly update detection rules/signatures  
- Filter out known benign traffic to reduce noise  
- Integrate alerts into your SIEM pipeline for centralized triage

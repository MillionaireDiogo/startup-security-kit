# 🎣 Phishing Simulation Guide for Startup SOCs

> Phishing simulations test employee readiness and help build a security-aware culture by safely exposing users to fake phishing emails.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Identify users susceptible to phishing attacks  
- Raise awareness of phishing techniques and red flags  
- Improve reporting rates of suspicious emails  
- Inform targeted training and awareness efforts  

---

## 🗓️ Planning Your Campaign

1. **Define goals and scope**  
   - Decide which teams or departments to test  
   - Set clear, achievable objectives (e.g., increase reporting by 30%)  

2. **Design realistic phishing emails**  
   - Use believable sender addresses and scenarios  
   - Include common phishing tactics like urgent requests or fake links  
   - Avoid actual malicious payloads or attachments  

3. **Setup infrastructure**  
   - Use open-source tools like [GoPhish](https://getgophish.com/) or low-cost commercial platforms  
   - Prepare landing pages to educate users after clicking

## 🚦 Running the Simulation

- Send phishing emails during normal work hours  
- Track user actions: clicks, submissions, reports  
- Provide immediate feedback or training for users who fall for the simulation  

---

## 📝 Post-Simulation Actions

- Analyze results and identify patterns (who clicked, who reported)  
- Share aggregate results with leadership and users  
- Offer targeted training to vulnerable groups  
- Schedule regular simulations (e.g., quarterly)  

---

## 🛠️ Best Practices

- Ensure leadership buy-in and communicate the purpose clearly  
- Keep simulations confidential to avoid stigma  
- Use simulations as a learning tool, not punishment  
- Regularly update email templates to stay relevant
